## User guide :
This software is a java based CLI which allows you to convert a Json file to XML and vice versa and thus include the following commands :

| Command   |           Purpose           |
|:----------|:---------------------------:|
| XMLToJson | Converts a XML file to Json |
| JsonToXML | Converts a Json file to XML |
| help      | Shows the list of commands  |

In order to use the program you can use [the compiled .jar](build/JConvert_20231008_release.jar) file and run it as it follows or clone this repo and build it yourself

Then run the following command in a command prompt taking care of filling the placeholders :

```
java -jar [file path of the buid] [XMLToJson/JsonToXML] -f [inputFile] -o [outputFile]
```

If the conversion was done successfully you should get a resul similar to this :

```
The conversion from Json to XML was done successfully
Time elapsed : 184ms
```

If an error occurs, an explicit error message will be written :

```
[Explicit error message...]
The conversion from Json to XML failed unexpectedly
Time elapsed : 115ms
```

In the case of a Json / XML parsing error, the specific line and column causing the error will be specified allowing you to debug your file more easily.
In this example we tried to convert an XML file to Json with the wrong command (JsonToXML)

```
Unexpected character ('<' (code 60)): expected a valid value (JSON String, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')
at [Source: (File); line: 1, column: 2]
The conversion from Json to XML failed unexpectedly
Time elapsed : 156ms
```
