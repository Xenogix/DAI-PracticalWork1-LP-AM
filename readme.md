## User guide :
This software is a Java-based CLI that allows you to convert a Json file into XML and vice versa, and therefore includes the following commands :

| Command   |           Purpose           |
|:----------|:---------------------------:|
| XMLToJson | Converts a XML file to Json |
| JsonToXML | Converts a Json file to XML |
| help      | Shows the list of commands  |

In order to run the program you can download [the compiled .jar file](build/JConvert_20231008_release.jar) or clone this repo and build it yourself using maven.

Then run the following command in a command prompt taking care of filling the placeholders :

```
java -jar [file path of the compiled .jar] [XMLToJson/JsonToXML] -f [inputFile] -o [outputFile]
```

If the conversion was done successfully you should get a result similar to this :

<sup>(In the following examples we are using the JsonToXML command)</sup>

```
The conversion from Json to XML was done successfully
Time elapsed : 184ms
```

If an error occurs, an explicit error message will be written :

```
[Explicit error message...]
The conversion from Json to XML failed unexpectedly
Time elapsed : 115ms
```

In the case of a Json / XML parsing error, the specific line and column causing the error will be specified allowing you to debug your file more easily.
In this example we tried to convert an XML file to Json with the wrong command (JsonToXML)

```
Unexpected character ('<' (code 60)): expected a valid value (JSON String, Number, Array, Object or token 'null', 'true' or 'false')
at [Source: (File); line: 1, column: 2]
The conversion from Json to XML failed unexpectedly
Time elapsed : 156ms
```

### Commands parameters :

|:-----|:-------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| -f   |    --file     | Specify the input file path                               |
| -o   |   --output    | Specify the output file path                              |
| -i   | --indentation | Indicate whether the output file should be indented       |

| -V   |   --version   | Print the current version of the command                  |

By default, the generated output file is indented but this can be specified using the indentation parameter.
